# node-osrm

__deprecated__ This repository is deprecated since node-osrm has been [moved](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/3183) into the main [osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/) repository. Find the [documentation there](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/blob/master/docs/nodejs/api.md).

node-osrm provided read-only bindings to the [Open Source Routing Machine - OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend), a routing engine for OpenStreetMap data implementing high-performance algorithms for shortest paths in road networks.
